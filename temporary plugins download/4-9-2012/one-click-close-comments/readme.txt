Conveniently close or open comments for a post or page with one click.


== Description ==

Conveniently close or open comments for a post or page with one click.

From the admin listing of posts ('Edit Posts') and pages ('Edit Pages'), a user can close or open comments to any posts to which they have sufficient privileges to make such changes (essentially admins and post authors for their own posts).  This is done via an AJAX-powered color-coded indicator.  The color-coding gives instant feedback on the current status of the post for comments: green means the post/page is open to comments, red means the post/page is closed to comments.  Being AJAX-powered means that the change is submitted in the background without requiring a page reload.

This plugin will only function for administrative users in the admin who have JavaScript enabled.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `one-click-close-comments.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. When on the 'Edit Posts' or 'Edit Pages' admin pages, click the indicators to toggle the comment status for a post, as necessary.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can see the colored dots indicating current commenting status, but why aren't they clickable? =

The commenting status link/button is only clickable is you have JavaScript enabled.

= What does the color-coding of the dot mean? =

Green means the post is currently open for comments; red means the post is not currently open for comments.

= How can I customize the color-coding used for the dot? =

You can customize the colors via CSS.  `.comment-state-1` indicates comments are open.  `.comment-state-0` indicates comments are closed.

= How can I customize the dot used to represent commenting status? =

By default, commenting status is represented using the `&bull;` character.  You can change this by filtering `c2c_one_click_close_comments_click_char`.  Here's an example -- added to a theme's functions.php file -- to change it to a solid diamond:

`add_filter( 'c2c_one_click_close_comments_click_char', create_function('$a', 'return "&diams";') );`


== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the 'Edit Posts' admin page with the plugin activated. (The full tool-tip reads: "Comments are closed. Click to open.")


== Filters ==

The plugin exposes one action for hooking.

= c2c_one_click_close_comments_click_char (action) =

The 'c2c_one_click_close_comments_click_char' hook allows you to use an alternative character or string as the plugin's indicator in the posts listing tables.  It is the character that get color-coded to indicate if comments are open or close, and the thing to click to toggle the comment open status.  By default this is a bullet, `&bull;` (a solid circle).

Arguments:

* $char (array): The character to be used for display (by default this is `&bull;`).

Example:

`
add_filter( 'c2c_one_click_close_comments_click_char', 'custom_one_click_char' );
function custom_one_click_char( $char ) {
	return '&diams;';  // Use a diamond character instead of the bullet
}
`
