1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

It uses the custom post type feature to create a dedicated FAQ section in your WordPress site, including categories and tags exclusive to them.

= How Do I Use It? =

Each FAQ acts like a "post". You can assign your own categories (called topics) or tags and organize as you see fit. You can also use shortcodes to place them on any page as follows:

* For the complete list: 
	place [faq] on a post / page
	
* For a single FAQ: 
	place [faq faq_id="ID"] on a post / page
	
* List all from a single FAQ topic category: 
	place [faq faq_topic="topic-slug"] on a post / page
	
* List all from a single FAQ tag: 
	place [faq faq_tag="tag-slug"] on a post / page
	
Please note that the shortcode can't handle a query of multiple categories in a single shortcode. However, you can stack them as such:
	...content....
	[faq faq_topic="topic-slug-one"]
	[faq faq_tag="tag-slug-two"]

The list will show 10 FAQs based on your sorting (if none has been done, it will be in date order). 
* To display only 5: 
	place [faq limit="5"] on a post / page

* To display ALL: 
	place [faq limit="-1"] on a post / page
